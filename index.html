 <!--Think mobile first in CSS. Start with general layout/styles in code first. Then proceed with iPhone screen, then for iPad dimensions, and then for
 desktop. Look up jquery for carousel and CSS code for the menu. Pretty sure both are readily available online and I will source the jquery. swipe.js takes ipad and iphone screen
 into account for the carousel.-->

    <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia,
there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the
Semantics, a large language ocean.</p>


    <p>
     A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary 
regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth.

    <p>
Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost
unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem
Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to
do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas.
