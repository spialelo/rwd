--------------------
Responsive design possibly 90% nailed down. Test menu/navigation also displaying and hiding at appropriate dimensions.

2015.02.12 - Update
--------------------
Implemented the navigation icon, my own way. Found other versions, but was unable to pin point why they were not fully rendering. Next time, use an image or SVG.

--------------------
Implemented carousel using Ken Wheeler's Slick carousel. http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/

Update #2: Carousel 4/5 working. There is a container/overflow issue, that I'm looking into. Also need to implement the jQuery to make home link active or style it inline.

--------------------
Completed as much as I can.
